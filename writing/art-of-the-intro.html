                <h4><b>The Art of the Intro</b></h4>
                <h6>November 13, 2024</h6>
                <p>A friend of mine, we’ll call Kyle, is looking to transition from working as a bench scientist to a
                    business development
                    (BD) role in biotech or pharma. When he mentioned this I offered to introduce him to a friend and
                    former classmate of
                    mine who happens to head BD at a major biotech company. We’ll call her Mary. Kyle was thrilled at
                    the opportunity, but
                    before making the introduction, I gave him an assignment: check the job boards at Mary’s company and
                    see if there were
                    any open roles on her team. This would lead to three possible introduction scenarios:<br><br>
                    1. <b>General Advice:</b> I introduce Kyle to Mary and ask her to share advice on getting into
                    BD.<br>
                    2. <b>Role-Specific Intro:</b> I introduce Kyle to Mary as a candidate for a specific role on her
                    team, highlighting why he’d
                    be a great fit.<br>
                    3. <b>Proactive Pitch:</b> I introduce Kyle to Mary with the suggestion that he’d be a fantastic
                    addition to her team, even if
                    no role currently exists, and encourage her to keep him in mind for the future.<br><br>
                    The differences between these scenarios are substantial. In Scenario 1, Mary is doing me a favor by
                    giving her time to
                    share insights with Kyle—a gesture rooted in goodwill and little else. But in Scenarios 2 and 3, the
                    dynamic shifts:
                    Kyle becomes a potential asset to Mary, a “rockstar new hire” she may not have known she
                    needed.<br><br>
                    If Kyle isn’t interested in Mary’s company, then Scenario 1 is perfectly fine. However, if he’s even
                    remotely interested
                    in joining her team, it’s worth crafting a more thoughtful introduction along the lines of Scenario
                    2 or 3. First
                    impressions matter. If we’re setting the stage for Kyle as an ideal candidate, we need to tell a
                    compelling story that
                    sparks excitement—especially in Scenario 3, where no job posting exists.<br><br>
                    The Scenario 3 approach reminds me of an excellent blog <a
                        href="https://nanransohoff.substack.com/p/finding-a-job-in-climate?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true">post</a>
                    by a friend, Nan Ransohoff, about creating your own job opportunities
                    rather than waiting for one to appear. It’s an underrated strategy. Many of the best candidates I’ve
                    interviewed as a
                    hiring manager were proactive in this way, showcasing initiative and creativity and creating FOMO in
                    me.<br><br>
                    Reflecting on this conversation, I was reminded that making introductions is an art. Early in my
                    career, I was oblivious
                    to this. I would jump into meetings or introductions with no clear goal, often realizing what I
                    needed from the other
                    person only after the conversation was over.<br><br>
                    I learned a better approach from Deena Shakir, an incredible BD dealmaker I worked with during her
                    time at Google [X].
                    Deena’s background—working for the Secretary of State, USAID, and as a BBC reporter—sharpened her
                    negotiation and social
                    acumen. Now a successful venture capitalist, she continues to exemplify the strategic thinking
                    required to navigate
                    high-stakes interactions.<br><br>
                    Deena taught me the importance of doing my homework before requesting an introduction. What’s my
                    goal? What value can I offer the other person? When it comes to introductions, it’s not just about
                    making connections; it’s about setting the stage for success. The art of the intro lies in crafting
                    an opportunity where both sides stand to gain something meaningful, after all everyone loves a
                    win-win.
