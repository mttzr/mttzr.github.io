        <h4><b>Doing Science Without a PhD</b></h4>
        <h6>June 20, 2024</h6>
        <p>
          My early twenties were marked by two key milestones: graduating from college and starting—and then
          stopping—graduate school. First, I tried medical school, only to realize I didn’t actually want to be a
          doctor. Then I gave a PhD program a shot, but I found that path wasn’t right for me either. I loved science
          and
          wanted to work in a technical field (this is why I kept applying to grad school), but the opportunity
          costs—time and money, but mostly time—felt too steep for both.<br><br>

          As a grad student, I often found myself distracted, spending hours scrolling through Hacker News and
          TechCrunch, envying the people out in the world building and launching products and companies. It seemed like
          I had another decade of studying ahead of me before I could achieve my true aspiration: build something
          impactful that changed lives. That envy eventually gave me the
          courage to leave school and move to San Francisco. <br><br>

          Now, when people ask about my academic background (this happened today at lunch with a scientist from a
          neighboring lab), I often joke that I’m “not a doctor two ways.”<br><br>

          But here’s the truth: doing science doesn’t require a PhD. While I greatly respect the rigorous training that
          comes with a PhD—so much so that I actively seek out PhDs (or those with similar advanced scientific degrees)
          to join my team—it’s neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for building scientific companies,
          organizations, or products.<br><br>

          Plenty has been written about the evolution (and sometimes, the critique) of higher education. I’m not here to
          add to that discourse. Instead, I want to share what my experience has been like working in biotech without a
          PhD, focusing on where it’s helped me and where it’s been a challenge.<br><br>

          <b>Where It’s Helped</b><br><br>

          <b>1. Asking Questions</b><br>
          Not having a PhD has freed me from the pressure of feeling like I should already know everything. I don’t
          hesitate to ask questions, which I believe is a superpower for any good leader. Curiosity is essential to
          innovation, and being comfortable with “not knowing” has opened doors to deeper understanding and
          collaboration.<br>
          <b>2. Early Industry Experience</b><br>
          I spent my 20s bouncing between startups, learning how to build teams, identify product-market fit, and
          fundraise. These skills—what I think of as the “holy trinity” of company building—are hard to master from a
          textbook or academic environment. They require practice, and I’ve simply had more cycles to refine
          them.<br>
          <b>3. No Attachment to Expertise</b><br>
          My time in biotech startups has been delightfully varied. I’ve worked on oncology diagnostics, drug discovery
          AI platforms, and RNA vaccines. This variety has brought me incredible joy because I’m constantly learning.
         I've seen more technical folks feel a strong attachment to their specific area of study—or even a fear branching
          out beyond it. I have no such attachment. Instead, I let my enthusiasm and excitement for a product or space
          guide my focus.<br><br>

          <b>Where It’s Hurt</b><br><br>

          <b>1. Fundraising with Traditional Biotech Investors</b><br>
          Some investors in biotech still hold traditional views about credentials. While I’ve successfully raised
          funding, I’ve sometimes had to work harder to build credibility without the “Dr.” in front of my name.<br>
          <b>2. Imposter Syndrome in Highly Credentialed Spaces</b><br>
          Being surrounded by people with advanced degrees—particularly in highly technical or scientific
          discussions—can sometimes spark imposter syndrome. Even
          when I know I bring valuable skills to the table, it’s hard not to compare myself to others with more formal
          training.<br>
          <b>3. Higher Barrier to Entry in Certain Technical Conversations</b><br>
          Not having spent years immersed in a specific scientific discipline during a PhD means I sometimes have to put
          in extra effort to prepare for highly technical conversations. While this has pushed me to become a stronger
          generalist, it can occasionally feel like a disadvantage in specialized discussions.<br><br>

          <b>Should You Get a PhD?</b><br><br>

          If you’re on the fence about pursuing a PhD, the answer depends on your goals. Here’s my take:<br>
          • If you want to be a CSO or scientific leader: A PhD is often essential. It equips you with the technical
          depth and credibility needed to lead research programs and be recognized as an authority in your field.<br>
          • If you want to found a biotech company as a CEO: You don’t necessarily need a PhD, but you’ll need to build
          a strong team. This usually means finding a co-founder or key hire with deep scientific expertise to
          complement your skill set.<br><br>

          <b>Final Thoughts</b><br><br>

          While I’ve occasionally felt the limitations of not having a PhD, I’ve mostly felt great pride in
          building my career outside the traditional academic path. Science thrives on diversity of thought, and the
          field needs leaders with a range of experiences—not just those who follow the well-trodden route.<br><br>

          Doing science without a PhD is entirely possible. What matters most is a clear sense of purpose, a willingness
          to learn, and the determination to build something meaningful.
