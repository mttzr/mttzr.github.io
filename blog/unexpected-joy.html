        <h4><b>The Unexpected Joy of Not Getting What You Want</b></h4>
        <h6>May 17, 2024</h6>
        <p>
          I’m thirty-five years old today! Can you believe it? I can’t. That’s halfway to 70! Halfway to being an age
          appropriate love interest on the Golden Girls, to gray hair and reading glasses, and to whatever the
          equivalent of texting with one finger will be on a Neuralink. If you look at US life expectancy (73.5 years
          for a male), this means I’m also just at the cusp of the midway point, the half-time show of the game of life.
          And much like the best half-time shows, this one will be fueled by nostalgia.

          One of my main life learnings to date is that all people, from rural subsistence farmers to billionaire
          bankers, love to talk about themselves. Main character syndrome is in our DNA. DNA is so main character
          syndrome that it exists just to make more of itself. Even people that feign humbleness or insist that good
          manners would prevent them from hogging the spotlight will, if they feel they’ve found a genuine audience,
          leap at the opportunity to get into the nitty gritty of all the steps, decisions, and chance encounters that
          led them, their parents, and as many generations of their family lore they can summon, to their being in this
          exact place at this exact time. I’ve used this tactic to get to know people who I find interesting and to make
          the most of social situations where I’m just waiting for the wall clock to expire. And here I am using it
          again, this time on myself.

          But rather than reflect on my entire life to date (too boring, trust me I was there), I instead set out to use
          my experiences to understand another seemingly fundamental truth that I hope to keep top of mind in the second
          half of my life: the unexpected joy of not getting what you want.

          At the end of college I applied to medical school because, up until that point, working as a doctor was the
          only job I had seriously considered. Being a doctor meant doing good and my primary motivation in the
          periadolescent era was to do things that were definitely good (there are several too-close-to-home essays that
          explain this psyche including the best little boy in the world). I was waitlisted and ultimately rejected and
          told to apply again the following year. I moved to New York City, started working, reapplied and then was
          admitted to medical school. But by the time I was walking the halls of the hospital, my supposed forever home
          already felt like a prison. In the months between wanting to go to medical school and starting medical school
          I had taken the unexpected route of living in New York and meeting people who did non-doctor jobs–folks who
          worked in science, finance, consulting, the written and performing arts, and (most formatively for me) in
          tech. After a year of learning the ways people spent their time as not doctors, I found myself suffocating
          when talking to my fellow medical students who could opine about little more than medicine. This is not a read
          of doctors, I absolutely want my urologist to have exactly one thing on his mind, but rather more a
          realization that my mind doesn’t naturally gravitate to such a singular focus. In the end, med school wound up
          being very hard to get into but very easy to drop out of and I’m so grateful for that first year post-grad
          where I didn’t get exactly what I wanted.

          Years later, at Google my first product was abruptly shut down by the executive team. We built a telemedicine
          product into Google search so folks didn’t need to go to the doctor’s office for all their health questions -
          Google could have been the biggest healthcare marketplace in history in a post-COVID world but I promise I’m
          not still bitter. Instead, I was asked to go work on Google image search, specifically to figure out how to
          add a star button so folks could save their images and Google could compete with Pinterest. This sounded as
          boring to me then as hopefully it was for you to read now. So instead I left the company, a place where I
          thought I would happily work for decades, maybe the rest of my life (lawls). I decided to try working at
          startups because if my fate was to be controlled by the whims of an executive I at least wanted the executive
          to know my name. I started at Uber, which at the time was still very much a start up, the executives knew my
          name (this I came to instantly regret) and I have never looked back. Now I’m the CEO of my own startup, a
          second time founder, and I love work more than I ever thought possible (including during my cushy Google
          days). If I had been given the green light at Google I’m so afraid I would still be there, doing PERF,
          complaining about free food, and entrusting my valuable time and energy to the hands of a bunch of middle
          managers who, just like the rest of us, have basically no clue what they are doing and are wrong more often
          than they are right. So, again, I’m so thankful I didn’t get what I wanted.

          When I was a kid I thought I’d marry a girl, but it turns out I’m gay and too polite to seriously entertain a
          secret second life so I never did. At this point in my life, I don’t think a week goes by when I don’t tell my
          gay husband or one of my gay friends how happy I am to be gay and/or not to be straight. No offense to
          straight people but if an un-homo elixir existed there aren't enough fungible assets on Earth to entice me to
          take it (and if you’re a scientist out there working on said elixir I’d do a little more market analysis
          before doubling down on this roadmap). Sure being gay means there are places where you shouldn’t hold hands in
          public, but there are other reasons why Riyad isn’t a top ten travel destination. Being gay means no rules, no
          roles, no expectations - you just get to wake up every day and make it all up which, by the way I think
          straight people do too but then they have to make sure everything they make up also fits into a complex set of
          expectations or else they will get side-eyed by their peers or, worse, not invited to couples’ dinners. Being
          gay gives you access to a supportive community that is beautiful inside (sometimes) and outside (always) and
          has the absolute best memes. It’s like a lifelong social club where initiation is a little bit of trauma but
          then you have access to cute little visitor centers (gay bars) in the most fashionable district of every
          beautiful place on earth. Turns out laughing on tradwife TikTok is so much more fun for me than actually
          having a tradwife.

          If you’re still reading, firstly hi mom, and secondly, you might be thinking this sounds like a very long
          winded rehashing of the good old “look on the bright side of things” or “make lemonade out of lemons”, but I
          am aiming to be much more pointed and aggressive than that. People should make the most of unexpected
          situations, but they should also view their plans for life with extreme skepticism because, more often than
          not, these plans are bad or at least very ill informed. This isn’t because of any sort of malice or even
          laziness, it’s just the natural limitation of building a vision for life with only the building blocks at hand
          and none of the higher equality, super sleek, new-age building materials or knowledge that become available in
          the days and months and years ahead. Does this mean we shouldn’t make plans or set goals entirely? Probably
          not. But it does mean our plans should be held loosely, and when they are abandoned, done with an
          understanding that they were conceived in an information vacuum that would have made it more surprising than
          not for them to come to fruition or be satisfying in the long run.

          Recently, after many years of attempting to have children (both the old-fashioned way and finally with a few
          doctors), my partner and I faced the reality that this may not be in the cards for us. While these discussions
          were initially filled with sadness, we found great comfort in the fact that we love our lives as they exist
          today, and almost all of our favorite parts of life are people or activities we wouldn’t have predicted even a
          year or two ago. Together, we found peace and even excitement at the idea that any parenting void would
          rapidly be filled by something beautiful, amazing, and totally impossible for us to predict.

          I’ll end by adding that an appreciation of the unexpected joy of not getting what you want has also become an
          effective filter for identifying who should be the closest relationships in my life. I am incredibly social,
          so there are more people in my life than beauty rest requirements would allow me to build meaningful
          relationships with. The folks I have gravitated to and with whom I’ve shared the deepest laughter and tightest
          hugs are those who know this joy firsthand. Probably because, in our core, we understand, as a much more
          famous gay once more succinctly captured over 100 years ago, that life is too important to be taken seriously.
