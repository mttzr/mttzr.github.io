                <h6>June 13, 2024</h6>
                <p>
                    Eleven years ago, I moved to SF and within my first seven days, I found myself at the beach,
                    surfboard in hand, preparing to paddle out alongside a woman I met at a bar the night before.
                    Neither of us knew it at the time, but we were about to become lifelong friends. The story of my
                    time in SF is intertwined with my growth as a surfer. This coming weekend, I’m participating in my
                    first surfing exhibition, an event specifically for queer surfers. Imagine a surf competition but
                    with more heels on the beach and everyone gets a medal. I’m excited for the weekend, but not because
                    I think I’m going to do well. In fact, I’ll be shocked if I do. I tend to get performance anxiety
                    when it comes to this particular water sport. When I’m in the lineup and see a zoom lens on the
                    beach, I end up spending so many mental cycles trying to focus on looking cool that I forget how to
                    paddle or balance, and end up looking quite the opposite. And yet, I’m still excited. My excitement
                    mostly comes from the fact that I’ll be paddling out in a heat, shoulder to shoulder with friendly
                    and supportive surfers. This is the joy of the queer surf community; folks aren’t jockeying for
                    waves, they’re just excited to see one another in the ocean. On the eve of this personal milestone
                    event, I’m reflecting on what surfing has taught me over the past decade and what I hope the
                    relationship looks like in the decades to come.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h6><b>Lesson 1 - Non-Attachment</b></h6>
                    Like any good Bay Area technobro, I have read the first few chapters and the jacket covers of a
                    number of Buddhist and pop-Buddhist texts. The buzzwords I can most crisply recall all have to do
                    with the concept of non-attachment: detachment from an outcome, present-moment awareness, emotional
                    balance, and acceptance—all concepts that surfing will throw in your face whether you’re ready or
                    not. When you find your way to the water, some days are just plain bad. The conditions might not be
                    right; it’s too windy, too choppy, too flat—it sometimes seems like there are more ways for the
                    water to be wrong than right. And other days, you’re just not quite right—your paddle is weak, your
                    balance is off, you get cold so quickly you check your suit for holes. And on some days, it’s a mix
                    of all—both you and the ocean are just not having it. On these days, I’ve learned to just take a
                    deep breath, catch one last wave in (or, if I’m really at a loss, just paddle back to shore), pack
                    up, and go home. This might sound like I’m giving up, and in some micro sense, I am. In these
                    moments, I’m choosing to give up on this particular day because I know that there are more days to
                    surf, more waves to be caught. Just this last weekend, I made my way to a break near the town of Bolinas (a favorite of mine), only
                    to arrive late due to a work commitment and to find my surf friend had already headed home and the
                    waves were quite gusty and messy. The vibes weren’t right, so after 60 minutes in the water, I
                    packed up and started my journey back. Seventy-two hours and one last-minute text later, I found
                    myself back in the water with another friend for a sunset session at another break, catching
                    glorious waves in the warm sunlight for well over three hours. The ocean giveth and the ocean taketh
                    away. The lesson for me here is that there are always more waves. This is true of missing a wave in
                    a set or scrapping an entire session. We can’t mourn what we missed out on or what failed to
                    manifest, but just keep focused on the waves to come.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h6><b>Lesson 2 - Progress is Beside the Point</b></h6>
                    If I told Matt from 10 years ago that I was still surfing, he’d be thrilled. But if I showed him a
                    clip of me surfing today, he’d be like, “WTF?” (Matt from 10 years ago was very judgmental). The
                    reason is that improvement in surfing is linear with time, but the slope of that improvement is
                    shallow.<br>
                    
                    <br><img src="https://www.returntozehnder.com/images/SurfSkillvsTime.png" alt="Surf Skill vs Time Chart"><br>  
                    
                    
                    To be more precise, the day-by-day data points tend to be fairly scattered
                    (at least in my chaotic case), but if you were to fit a line, that line would overall be positive…
                    just a very mild gradient. But what proto-Matt circa 2013 wouldn’t be able to understand is that the graph doesn’t actually
                    matter. The reason why he/I/we continue to surf isn’t to make progress on some graph (though, to be
                    clear, the highs of making progress are fantastic), it’s just for the joy of doing the thing at all.
                    The only way to enjoy surfing is to find joy in the good days and the bad days—the days when you
                    make yourself so proud for catching a beautiful wave and gliding into the pocket, and the days when
                    you’re just happy you didn’t drown. My love for the sport is consistent, and that’s the real
                    achievement.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h6><b>Lesson 3 - Everything is Better with Friends</b></h6>
                    I’m a social surfer, which is weird. For most people, surfing is a solo activity—a time to be alone
                    with their thoughts and the ocean. I, on the other hand, love nothing more than paddling out with 1
                    to 50 friends, chatting constantly as we battle our way through the whitewash out to the calmness of
                    the lineup. Once there, and once we’ve caught our breath, I can gab for hours (or whatever the
                    period is between sets) about life at the day, week, month, or lifetime zoom level. One surf friend
                    calls these discussions “board meetings” because they can carry some weight and big decisions can be
                    made. Then, after we’ve made a catch (or attempted and fumbled), we cheer each other on from the
                    lineup, celebrating our comrades as they make their way back out past the whitewater. For many years, I felt like I wasn’t a real surfer because I didn’t enjoy going by myself. When
                    surfing alone, I find myself less motivated to stay in the water when it gets cold. I experience a
                    lower dopamine rush when I catch a beautiful wave that I can’t share with a friend, and I feel more
                    nervous when I wipe out hard and don’t have a friend to check that I’m still alive. However, a
                    decade in, I’ve accepted that my preference for social surfing doesn’t make me any less of a surfer.
                    In fact, the friendships I’m making are enhancing my experience. Away from cell service and other
                    distractions, I find I’m able to be exceptionally present, splitting my attention only between the
                    conversation and the waves forming out at sea. The folks I’ve connected with span many more
                    demographics than I’d normally find in my cohort of obvious friends—but we are all united by our joy
                    for the sport. One day, my therapist might fix me so I can stand spending large chunks of time alone
                    with my thoughts. Until that day comes, I’m going to enjoy the friends I’m making along the way.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h6><b>Lesson 4 - Spend More Time Giving yYour Body What It Wants</b></h6>
                    I did not grow up watching surfing or idolizing surf culture. In fact, by the time I moved from
                    California to the East Coast for college, I had started to purposefully distance myself (at least
                    mentally) from the surf and skate aesthetic that defined early 2000s teenage wardrobe—mine included.
                    It was a culture that I participated in as a Californian teen, not one that I chose. But while I
                    didn’t grow up with a love of surfing, or of athletics more generally, I have always enjoyed
                    physical activity. I was never strong or coordinated, so ball sports and contact sports were off the
                    table, but I did (and still do) have a lot of endurance. Living in a landlocked place, this
                    endurance was put to use running outside. I ran track and I ran with my mom (it was basically a
                    glass closet), and though I find the act of running boring, the slowly changing scenery of our
                    suburban town provided enough of a distraction to get the job done. I tried a few times to run on a
                    treadmill and nearly fell off just to mix things up. Lap swimming was far too monotonous, and while
                    road biking can have beautiful changing scenery, I found the position on the bike feels unnatural—a
                    strange subset of muscles activated while others are left totally inert. The amazing thing about
                    surfing is that it is an endurance activity that engages basically every muscle but is so dynamic
                    that no two waves (or two minutes) are exactly the same. Why do I love endurance sports? Because of
                    how they make me feel afterward. Food tastes better after a derived hunger. I sleep better, and I
                    just feel a high that lasts for hours. If each wave is a dopamine hit, the collective build-up of
                    dopamine is even more powerful.<br>
                    <br>
                    In closing, I hope that this still marks the beginning of my relationship with surfing. I aim to
                    keep these four lessons top of mind while also remaining open to whatever else the sport and the
                    ocean has to teach me.
